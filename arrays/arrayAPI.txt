Functions description of the arrays API

*every function takes a type T array arr and an int& length and use templates*

add: takes T t and inserts t to the end of arr.
insert: takes T t, int i and inserts t at position i of arr.
remove: takes int i and deletes the element at position i.
find: takes K k, int cmpTK(T, K) and returns the pos of the first appearance of K in arr or a negative value. /len is not passed by reference/ 
orderedInsert: takes T e, int cmpTT(T, T) and inserts e in arr based on the cmpTT criteria.
sort: takes int cmpTT(T, T) and sorts arr based on cmpTT sort precedence mode.

int cmpTK(T t, K k) is a function that specifies the search form that is being used.
